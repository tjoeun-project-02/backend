These were initially tasted blind, revealed one at a time. First up, a classic.N: This has to be the Doublewood, one of the most consistent malts around. It smells as always, like a soft fluffed-up malty pillow with a soft sour-sweet yeasty citrus profile.T: Sweet and floury-fluffy popcorn-like honey malt with a super-soft [Egyptian] cotton mouthfeel.F: Soft comforting dry and not a hint of astringency.C: This is right up there with the best batches I've had in the last 15 years. This is my benchmark for Balvenie's contemporary distillery profile.",

Colour: gold. Nose: fine, easy, relatively earthy, with raisins, malt, a touch of PX, and drops of cough syrup. A little honey as well, high-honey-content gingerbread, but rather less oranges than usual. Mouth: very malty, then raisiny, with a little earthy oak and natural chocolate (no supermarket junk by multinationals… err… excuse me). Enjoy this leafiness as well. Finish: short, but pleasantly grassy/oaky and malty. Ovaltine and green tea. Coffee in the aftertaste. Comments: strictly nothing to complain about, and last time I checked, the price was fair. Perhaps is this expression becoming a little drier, having said that. SGP:451 – 80 points.",

Therefore, my expectation for the 12-year-old was a whisky that would taste similar. Unfortunately, I didn't look closely enough again; I probably thought that a whisky selling for an average of just under 60 euros would surely have an alcohol content of 43% to 46%. How much expectations and reality can diverge... So it has 40% ABV, well, Kavalan can produce a decent whisky with these specifications... Balvenie unfortunately can't with this one. With an average rating of 83, I wasn't expecting a flavor sensation, but in my opinion, it doesn't even come close to that score. You also can't really tell it's 12 years old, even though it doesn't taste young.",
