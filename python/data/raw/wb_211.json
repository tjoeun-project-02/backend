Aroma is pineapple cube sweets, apple flavoured bonbons (or just a mix of green apple and icing sugar), slight menthol, a soft buttery oakiness. Pretty nice aroma. Body is watery+. Taste is very flat and soft. Watery with the slightest sting in the tail. A vibe of vodka and soda maybe, but with some bitter oak tannins in the finish – white pepper and a light astringency. I’m not convinced I understand who this might be aimed at – leaning too bitter to be an introduction to whisky, but lacking anything that would make it particularly appealing to anyone else. Not unpleasant but has a very flat profile with a focus on the bitter oak tannins. Okay stuff - not bad but below average. 3.25/78",
